I developed a fitness app, that allows target users to gain information on how to be healthy and how to build muscle.
The app is quite easy to use, firstly the users will browser through the web-app andfind what they are interest in then, they will click on the link that would take them to a page they want, users can also sign-up, to do this the users will navigate to the register page where they can sign-up after signing up they can log in and have access to their dashboard.
